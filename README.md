# data-analysis-tools

This repository includes data analysis tools to primarily parse excel files with 
numerical and string data.

The scoring file is score_questionnaire.py. This file references the data_analysis.py file, which contains a digital library of questionnaire info. Simply add an entry to the dictionary data structure with the variable name "questionnaire info" in order to use the score_questionnaire.py file for your purposes. 

Note these files are designed to work on .csv files, not excel files.
